CHOICES
(You are allowed to choose a feature for some of the requirements. Indicate on the line
 which one you chose using the letter provided in the spec. Separate the letters with a comma

-------

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")
----------
Click on the "Toggle Theme" button that says "Switch to Dark/Light mode" switches the website between a dark theme and a light theme. 
The script adds/removes a '.light-mode' class to the body element and updates the button text accordingly.
The chosen theme preference is saved in localStorage so it persists across page loads and sessions.
The default theme is dark mode.
